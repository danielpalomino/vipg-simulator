This project groups compatible versions of the individual vipg projects. It
uses git submodule to reference working versions from the other vipg projects.
For a list of all (included) vipg projects see the output of 'git submodule
status'. There are currently three branches: master, next and devel. In the
master branch resides the current release, in the next branch the upcoming
release (should be pretty stable) and in the devel branch is a development
snapshot. The programs of all three branches are supposed to compile cleanly and
be usable.

For actual development versions you must directly pull the devel branches of
all repositories and build them manually.
